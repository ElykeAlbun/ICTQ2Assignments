			I already have a pug of my own named Uno, so it would seem best to have another one. My pet Uno is a pure black pug. He is not like the rest as he is very "makulit" as my mother would say.</li><li>Additional Details: <a href="https://animalcorner.org/dog-breeds/black-pug/">Here!</a></li></td>

			My dad and brother already have a bulldog each being over a year old so I would also like one for my own. One of the bulldog is Asia (My brother's dog). She is a small bulldog because she's a female. Bronson is the other dog and is the largest dog we have. He is very lazy and loves belly rubs.</li><li>Additional Details:<a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bulldog/">Here!</a></li></td>

			A Rottweiler would be a nice dog to have for intimidation and protection in the house. I also heard they are nicer than other think. This dog is what my dad would like to have but because of my mom disliking and being scared of the dog my dad resorted to a Bulldog.</li><li>Additional Details:<a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/rottweiler#/slide/1">Here!</a></li></td>
