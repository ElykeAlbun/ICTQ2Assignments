	<h1>Christmas Trees</h1>
	<h3>By Robert Frost</h3>
</div>
<div class="Poem">
	<p class="Para1">The city had withdrawn into itself<br>
And left at last the country to the country;<br>
When between whirls of snow not come to lie<br>
And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove<br>
A stranger to our yard, who looked the city,<br>
Yet did in country fashion in that there<br>
He sat and waited till he drew us out<br>
A-buttoning coats to ask him who he was.<br>
He proved to be the city come again<br>
To look for something it had left behind<br>
And could not do without and keep its Christmas.<br>
He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees;<br>
My woods—the young fir balsams like a place<br>
Where houses all are churches and have spires.<br>
I hadn’t thought of them as Christmas Trees.<br>
I doubt if I was tempted for a moment<br>
To sell them off their feet to go in cars<br>
And leave the slope behind the house all bare,<br>
Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.<br>
I’d hate to have them know it if I was.<br>
Yet more I’d hate to hold my trees except<br>
As others hold theirs or refuse for them,<br>
Beyond the time of profitable growth,<br>
The trial by market everything must come to.<br>
I dallied so much with the thought of selling.<br>
Then whether from mistaken courtesy<br>
And fear of seeming short of speech, or whether<br>
From hope of hearing good of what was mine, I said,<br>
“There aren’t enough to be worth while.”<br>
“I could soon tell how many they would cut,<br>
You let me look them over.”</p>
<p class="Para2"> “You could look.<br>
But don’t expect I’m going to let you have them.”<br>
Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too close<br>
That lop each other of boughs, but not a few<br>
Quite solitary and having equal boughs<br>
All round and round. The latter he nodded “Yes” to,<br>
Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one,<br>
With a buyer’s moderation, “That would do.”<br>
I thought so too, but wasn’t there to say so.<br>
We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over,<br>
And came down on the north. He said, “A thousand.”<br>
<br>
“A thousand Christmas trees!—at what apiece?”<br>
<br>
He felt some need of softening that to me:<br>
“A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars.”</p>
<p class="Para3">Then I was certain I had never meant<br>
To let him have them. Never show surprise!<br>
But thirty dollars seemed so small beside<br>
The extent of pasture I should strip, three cents<br>
(For that was all they figured out apiece),<br>
Three cents so small beside the dollar friends<br>
I should be writing to within the hour<br>
Would pay in cities for good trees like those,<br>
Regular vestry-trees whole Sunday Schools<br>
Could hang enough on to pick off enough.<br>
A thousand Christmas trees I didn’t know I had!<br>
Worth three cents more to give away than sell,<br>
As may be shown by a simple calculation.<br>
Too bad I couldn’t lay one in a letter.<br>
I can’t help wishing I could send you one,<br>
In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.</p>
